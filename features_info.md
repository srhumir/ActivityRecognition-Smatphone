#Variables definition
=================
##The names of variables are as fllows
- "id" : And identifier for measurment usable for data analysis puposes.

- "ActivityLable": Code related to the activity that subjects were doing at the time of measurment

- "ActivityName": Name of the activity that subjects were doing at the time of measurment

- "SubjectCode": Code of the person (subject) who the measurment was carried out on.

- The rest values are the mean and standard deviation of various measurment done on the subject. The description of the measurments are as follows


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

##We include the followig variales in our dataset: 

- mean(): Mean value

- std(): Standard deviation

- Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean

tBodyAccMean

tBodyAccJerkMean

tBodyGyroMean

tBodyGyroJerkMean
